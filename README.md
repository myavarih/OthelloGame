# OthelloGame

This project was created for my **Basic Programming (BP) class** in the month after **October 2023**.  
It focuses on applying the core programming concepts we learned in class.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to practice:

- Writing clean and structured code  
- Using variables, loops, and conditions  
- Handling input and output  
- Building small problem-solving programs  

The project helped me strengthen my logical thinking and improve my coding style.

## 🛠️ Features
- Implements core programming concepts step by step  
- Simple and beginner-friendly code structure  
- Demonstrates how to break down problems into smaller parts  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Compile the program (default language: **C++**).  
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o program
   ./program
   ```

## 📖 What I Learned
- How to approach programming problems systematically
- The importance of debugging and testing
- How small building blocks (loops, conditions, functions) can be combined to solve bigger problems
